We were still cramming everything into our panniers. A few hours later we woke up, at quarter past midnight. Our ferry would set sail at 3am. Our destination was St-Malo, France, and our little adventure would be an 8-day cycling tour of Brittany.

The plan was to take a train to Morlaix and cycle in a kind of U shape back to St-Malo, stopping in and passing through various places including Carlhaix-Plougher, Mur-De-Bretagne, Pontivy, Josselin, Paimpont Forest, Rennes, Dinan and finally Dinard.

We couldn’t pronounce any of these places except perhaps the last two. Maybe. So the Garmin would be used to get us where we needed to go as well as a nifty external battery to keep it charged. Everything rested on the technology doing its job. If it failed, we were doomed.

Our aim was to travel fast enough to make reasonable progress, but slow enough to admire the French countryside, take in its villages and most importantly, sample the local Patisseries. With the interests of our stomachs at the forefront of our minds, it would basically be a Tour De Pattiserie. We were fine with that.

After a very sleepy breakfast and a final sweep of the flat, we lumbered our bikes downstairs, attached our panniers and fumbled our way out of the front door. I was convinced that 5 minutes in one of us would get a puncture or the spokes on our wheels would collaborate in a collective “Ping!”.

Neither of these things happened and both bikes were absolutely fine. The twilight hours of a Saturday on the roads through Bournemouth and Poole were majestically quiet, only broken by the intermittent wails of binge drinkers, some way off in the distance.

Busy junctions were deserted and traffic lights remained green. The cyclists dream. We were almost there. Crossing the drawbridge into Poole Quay in the middle of the night felt like riding into a scene from any mob film, as two hooded men bowled down the road on our left and ageing fishing vessels bobbed eerily in the water on our right. I was sure there was a large shipment of drugs somewhere.

We were greeted by a chipper crew and were navigated to the ferry by a series of hi-viz jackets. We left on time and were soon roaring past Swanage, as our newly built ferry, the “Liberation”, pummelled through the waves at 50mph. It was difficult to sleep at this speed so I decided I would fare better in the viewing area.

Getting blasted by the wind wasn’t so great but staying outside long enough to watch the sunrise definitely was. The light was perfect. We passed St. Anne on our left as flocks of sea birds clustered around the big rocks which were strewn out from the island. The sun established itself as we docked into Guernsey, picking up more passengers for our final arrival into Jersey at 7.30am.

We had a five hour layover in Jersey and had no idea what to do. So we went to the old market hall for a second breakfast. We were approached by an old guy in a very smart suit. He seemed to know everyone in the building. He also wanted to know everything about us. He showed us to a good place to eat, where he had eaten breakfast every day for the past seven years. A pretty impressive record.

So our last meal in the UK was to be a typically British breakfast of egg, bacon and sausage, in fluffy white rolls, showered with ketchup. We had time to explore Jersey but opted to remain more-or-less stationary, still in confusion about what time it was and when we needed to get on the next ferry. When we did get on the ferry, it took just over an hour to get into St-Malo.

After a few seconds on the wrong side of the road we were underway. We were in France! Cue ITV’s Tour De France theme music in my head. Thankfully St-Malo wasn’t just a lifeless and generic ferry port. We winded through a network of confusing streets and one-way roads, passing the eateries in the old part of town, which simmered away in the late afternoon.

We were constantly reminded of all the things we were carrying, as bumps and cracks in the road were met with bangs and rattles of everything contained in our panniers. It was a great feeling of self-sufficiency as we freewheeled down the narrow and pretty little streets, knowing that we were pulling along everything we needed for the next week.

With everything closed except the restaurants, we headed straight for the campsite. Unfortunately for us the campsite was closed in June. We tried to find another campsite on the Garmin and discovered a patch of gravel with a few parked cars. It didn’t exist.

Third-time lucky? Check. Hidden behind a retail park was a fancy campsite with a pool. Nice! Our day of transit had come to an end. We will begin tomorrow with a train to Morlaix via Rennes which marks the real start of our cycling adventure.
