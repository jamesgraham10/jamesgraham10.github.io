summary: 'Himalayan inspired Todo Chrome app, and my first full-stack application. Uses the “MEAN” stack. Has a decoupled back-end. The front-end is an Angular 1 application that is downloaded through the chrome store. The front-end consumes an API which handles authentication and CRUD operations. I used Sketch to design each view.'
