summary: "Tripy is a travel itinerary planner that lets users plan each day of their trip. Users can add notes, activities and journeys to create an overview of their next adventure. This was my first attempt at building an application using the CRUD pattern. Itâ€™s an Angular 1 application that uses Firebase for data and authentication. It hooks into Firebase using the AngularFire plugin."
