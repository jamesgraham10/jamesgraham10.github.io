## Hello

My name is James and I'm a politics graduate turned full-stack developer. A bit of a pivot. I'm totally self-taught, from books, blogs, podcasts, YouTube, reading documentation, scouring GitHub issues and taking in the consensus from popular Stack Overflow answers.

## Skills

I'm now able to design, develop and deploy full-stack applications from the ground-up. I know my way around graphical editors like Sketch and Photostop. I'm confident with HTML and CSS and have experience with popular libraries like Bootstrap and Foundation although I can work without them (Flexbox to the rescue).

I'm confident with component-based front-end frameworks like Angular, React and Aurelia but still love working with jQuery and can get fairly far with VanillaJS. I love writing JavaScript.

Most of my back-end experience has been with the Node, Express and MongoDB stack but I've also had some practice with Rails and Laravel. But I'm very keen on the JS stack in general. Being able to write JavaScript everywhere feels great.
