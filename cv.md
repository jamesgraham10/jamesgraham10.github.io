## Greetings!

Iâ€™m currently looking for my first job in the web industry. As someone that believes technology can be a positive thing, I want to work for an organisation whose foremost aim is to improve the lives of other people.

## About Me

I'm from a social sciences background, and have a degree which focused primarily on international politics, as well as a bit of philosophy and economics. After graduating I decided to learn to code, as I wanted a way of channelling my ideas into things people could use and interact with.

## The Learning Process

Learning to code was easily the hardest but most satisfying thing I've ever done. I taught myself by making projects and learning as I went. My first attempt at something decent was a 2015 UK Election Guide built with jQuery. I wanted to create a simple and at-a-glance way of comparing the policies of the main parties. The code was seriously hacky, but it worked reasonably well.

## Since Then

I have made several client-side MVC [projects](../projects) with Angular, have upped my game with SASS and front-end tooling in general, and I can create simple servers in Node and Express. I "released" an actual thing on the [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sherpa-todo-app/jjdodbkpmnamcpgifckblnicicabmhag) earlier in February.

Currently I'm learning Rails as I want to get better at application design and work in an environment where it is easy to write tests and follow best practices.

As I'm now familiar with many of the underlying web and programming concepts, picking up new languages, tools and frameworks is much easier than when I started.

## Current Skills

## More Things

I made use of the brilliant Free Code Camp, and after many algorithm challenges and small front-end projects, I gained a [Front-End Development Certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.com/jamesgraham10/front-end-certification), about 400 hours of work. All of the projects I made for this are on [Codepen](http://codepen.io/collection/DKweaq/).

## Hobbies

When I'm not starring at a screen, I love to travel, go to interesting places, eat delicious food and explore the countryside.
